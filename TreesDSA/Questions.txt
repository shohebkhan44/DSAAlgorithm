---

 7. Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

* LCA in Binary Tree
* LCA in BST

👉 Companies: Tier 1 (VERY IMPORTANT)

---

 8. Maximum Path Sum

* Maximum path sum between any nodes
* Maximum root-to-leaf path sum

👉 Companies: Amazon, Google, Microsoft
👉 Difficulty: Medium–Hard

---

## 🌳 BINARY SEARCH TREE (BST) QUESTIONS

 9. Validate Binary Search Tree

👉 Companies: Tier 1 & 2

---

 10. Insert / Delete in BST

👉 Companies: Tier 2 & 3

---

 11. Kth Smallest / Largest Element in BST

👉 Companies: Amazon, Adobe, Paytm

---

 12. Floor and Ceil in BST

👉 Companies: Tier 2, 3

---

## 🌲 ADVANCED TREE QUESTIONS (Mostly Tier-1)

👉 Companies: Amazon, Flipkart

---

## 🌴 TRENDING INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

 18. Morris Traversal

* Inorder traversal without recursion & stack

👉 Companies: Tier 1 (Bonus edge case)

---

 19. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

👉 Companies: Amazon, Microsoft

---

 20. Path Sum Problems

* Root-to-leaf path sum
* All paths with given sum

👉 Companies: Tier 1 & 2

---

## 📌 TIER-WISE FOCUS STRATEGY

 ✅ Tier-3 (Service / Entry Level)

Focus on:

* Traversals
* Height
* Count nodes
* Basic BST operations

---

 ✅ Tier-2 (Product / Mid-Level)

Add:

* Diameter
* Balanced Tree
* LCA
* Views of tree
* Kth smallest in BST

---

 ✅ Tier-1 (Top Product Companies)

Master:

* Serialize/Deserialize
* Construct tree
* Maximum path sum
* Advanced DFS/BFS patterns
* Optimization (O(n))

---

## 🔥 How to Study Trees Efficiently

1. Understand recursion clearly
2. Draw tree diagrams while solving
3. Solve 1–2 questions daily
4. Write code without looking after practice
5. Focus on edge cases
